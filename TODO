TODO:
	* add getdents for search victims
		* bonus for root user: directly go to /usr/bin /bin 
		* normal user: search in /home/user_name/bin/
	* code is too big so some cuts would be nice (many binaries doesn't have gap
	  between sections big enought)
	* add mechanism to distinguish infected files (maybe it's not needed because
	  virus is able to fill whole gap between sections).
